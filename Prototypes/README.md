## About Us
![About Us](https://github.com/Tim-coder-ops/Gym-Pal/blob/master/Prototypes/AboutUs.PNG)
This page gives a brief description about my passion for the gym and why I created this app. It also allows the user a means of feedback to constantly improve Gym Pal.

## Log New Workout and Recovery Screen
These pages are yet to be developed. The Log New Workout screen will allow the user to select their exercise, set number, weight, and reps. It will also display the users past history for the exercise they have selected. The Recovery Screen will allow the user to select an injured region and the app will provide recovery recommendations.
