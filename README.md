# Gym-Pal
 Application designed for logging workouts
## Inspiration
Throughout my time in the gym I have searched for gym apps that have all the features that I would want within a workout tracking app. I was never able to find one that had all of my desired functions. I have decided to create this application myself.
## Concept
This app should allow a user to effectively track all their workout and give them information to look back on to improve. It should have a list of available exercises per bodypart. It should allow the user to see their past weights and reps per exercise and view a graph of their volume.
