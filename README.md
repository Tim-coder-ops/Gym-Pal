# Gym-Pal
 Application designed for logging workouts
## Inspiration
Throughout my time in the gym I have searched for gym apps that have all the features that I would want within a workout tracking app. I was never able to find one that had all of my desired functions. I have decided to create this application myself.
## Concept
This app should allow a user to effectively track all their workout and give them information to look back on to improve. It should have a list of available exercises per bodypart. It should allow the user to see their past weights and reps per exercise and view a graph of their volume.
## Wire-Frames
The Home Page will have an integrated GIF of a gym, along with a features list and buttons to become a user and sign in.

The sign in page will prompt the user for their username and password. A link will also be on the page for users who forget their password.

The User Page will display a chart showing the users overall body volume. It will also show a chart for the users body weight. It will also provide links to all the funnctions of the app.

The Progress page will allow the user to view their past volume per bodypart along with their past workouts per exercise. These charts will be based on what the users selections. It will also display the users past body weight.
