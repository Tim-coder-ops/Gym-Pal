# Final Project Review

## Gym Pal Documentation 
(https://github.com/Tim-coder-ops/Gym-Pal/blob/master/README.md)

## Project Experience
  My overall experience with this project was on filled with learning. Since I was learning these concepts while building this application I often found myself learning that there were either better ways to do things or changes in the beginning would have made my project go smoother.
  
  ## What did I do right?
  I would say the main thing I did right for this project was the amount of research and resources I used. My original design for how this application would is different than it currently does and this is because I looked at other existing applications and found styles that I liked more. I also looked to find ways to utilize .NET core to aid me in building my application saving me time.
  
  ## What did I do wrong?
  I would say the main thing that I did wrong was starting to buld this application before I knew how to build all aspects of the app. This caused me to make simple mistakes that caused me extra time and at times forced me to go back and redesign aspects.
  
 ## Where were you lucky?
  The luck that I had throughout this project was the people I had available to help me. Whenever I had issues that I could not resolve on my own there were always people there willing to help me.
  
  ## What would you change / what do you know now that you wish you knew "then"?
   I would have tried to look up the methods I would use to build my application before starting it. Though I was learning how to build an application while building this one it may have helped the ovverall process to go smoother. I also would have lessened my total features that I wanted to create becasue as time went on I discovered I would not be able to complete all of them.
